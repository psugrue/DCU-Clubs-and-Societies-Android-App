If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.

Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.
For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.
